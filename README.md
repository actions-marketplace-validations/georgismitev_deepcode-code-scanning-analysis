# DeepCode Code Scanning Github Action

## What is it?

DeepCode Code Scanning Github Action allows to integrate DeepCode's bug finding capabilities within your code scanning pipeline. When a commit is triggered, [DeepCode](https://www.deepcode.ai) finds bugs and security vulnerabilities and repost them as part of your repository's code scanning alerts.
